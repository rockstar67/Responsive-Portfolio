            <p>My name is Randy and I am originally from the beautiful state of 
            Nevada and I grew up in the "Biggest Little City in the World" Reno.
            My earliest childhood dreams were to experience and see the world and I got
            my wish by joining the United States Navy. My natural human nature is to help
            and heal people so I received my nursing and medical training by being a 
            Hospital Corpsman and I really enjoyed my different duty stations around the world.
            </p>
    
            <p>My personal hobbies include, working out at the gym and running by the beach,
                because I love being near the ocean. I enjoy listening to all types of music
                and I enjoyed playing my electric guitar playing rock music. I enjoy experiencing
                different food cuisines with Asian and Mexican food my favorites.
            </p>

                <p>I have always been interested in a career in the digital revolution and web development and presently
                    I am in midst of a career change hoping to apply my passion and desire to make a difference in the digital
                    world and make a difference in others.
